Download or clone the PEX archive from GIT into  server\_root/modules/programs, where server\_root is the installation location of OpenBroadcaster Server.

Users with sufficient privileges can access the Admin->Modules menu to install the Program Manager module from the list of available modules. Installation will add tables to the server database, and enable changes to the Sidebar and Media menu. 

To disable the Program Manager, access the Admin->Modules menu to uninstall the module. Saved metadata will be lost, however the local module.php file may edited to preserve local data.
